Welcome to the UCR Biosensors and Microfluidics Laboratory website!  <br />
<br />
We design and develop innovative engineering tools to enable practical solutions for urgent challenges in health, agriculture, and the environment. Our research focuses on advancing fundamental science and creating low-cost, field-deployable technologies for sample preparation and biosensing. By integrating upstream sample processing with portable diagnostics, we aim to improve disease detection, environmental monitoring, and food safety through scalable and accessible solutions.  <br />
